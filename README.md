### Bugs

|    Bug   |   Fix   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Questions were not shuffling correctly on each quiz start.  | Implemented a shuffleQuestions() function to randomize the question array, ensuring questions appear in a different order each time. |
| The 'Next' button wasn't enabled after selecting an answer. | Created a nextBtnEnable() function to enable the button, allowing users to proceed to the next question. |
| Final score displayed incorrectly due to miscalculated correct answers.  | Adjusted the checkAnswer() function to track correct answers accurately.  |
| The welcome container lacked a heading, hence causing a warning in the w3c validator.  | Used div element to target the id.  |
| Goggle font was not imported correctly | Used the @import on the web to correct this rather than the link. |
